Incomplete game made for the 2020 Nokia 3310 GameJam

The theme of this game jame was *Death is Good*

The premise of the game was to act like Doodle Jump in that the goal is to bounce as high as possible. The caveat is there are no platforms to land on. This means when your character falls, it hits the bottom of the camera view and dies. The character's body then becomes a platform, and the player is able to jump on their previous body to get higher.

This game is incomplete, the only piece remaining is the camera movement script for the level scene.

Constraints:

Game must use the resolution of a Nokia 3310 Screen (84x48)

Game is only allowed to use 2 colors: #c7f0d8 and #43523d

Game can only use monophonic sound (one channel and one sound at a time)

Game can only have 12 control inputs (the same amount of keys on the Nokia 3310)
